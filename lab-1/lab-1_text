3.1: 
The reason uchar1 and schar1 show us different values is because both have the different typing with being unsigned and signed.
When its signed it means that it can access negative numbers so it would't reach 255 like uchar1 because there isnt enough space
to go that far so it made sense the answer is 127 for schar1
